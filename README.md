Analysis package for all-atom simulations of disordered and unfolded proteins.

CAMPARITraj was fully developed in the Pappu Lab (http://pappulab.wustl.edu) but is maintained by the Holehouse lab (http://holehouselab.com).

#### Update May 2019
This is the *development* repository of CAMPARITraj and SHOULD NOT be used for production. Seriously, it is being modified constantly and with no building requirements during code pushes. If you want a building copy PLEASE contact Alex directly! [last touched June 24th 2019].
